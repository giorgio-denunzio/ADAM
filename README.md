# ADAM
Advanced Data Analysis in Medicine

ADAM is a Research & Development group focused on software solutions for Medicine, based in Lecce (Italy), within the Laboratorio di Fisica Biomedica e Ambiente at the Department of Mathematics and Physics, University of Salento. It is affiliated with DReAM, the Laboratory of interDisciplinary Research Applied to Medicine.

ADAM includes researchers with expertise in Medical Physics, Computer Science, Life Sciences, and Medical Statistics, all sharing a strong background in software applications for Medicine.

Our main interest is the advanced processing of biomedical data for diagnostics, prognosis, and therapy assessment, in the context of Precision and Personalized Medicine.

We apply radiomics and artificial intelligence techniques to extract and analyze complex data from medical images, supporting clinical decision-making and enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

As specialists in the computerized processing of medical data, particularly diagnostic imaging, our goal is to automate and make some medical-diagnostic procedures operator-independent, especially, but not exclusively, in the oncological field.

This web repository showcases our past and current projects, offering insight into our research activities and software development efforts.
